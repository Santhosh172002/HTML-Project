        <li>Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS and JS library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages. </li>
        <li>The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project.</li>
        <li>As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking.</li>
        <li>Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for all HTML elements. </li>
    </ul>
